# spam_proj
Spam detection project inspired by an assignment in [Coursera's ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

[Simple website](https://arcane-thicket-31145.herokuapp.com/) that indicates whether an email's contents suggest that the email is spam/not spam.

### Outside sources:
1. [Ling-Spam dataset](http://csmining.org/index.php/ling-spam-datasets.html) used to update my vocab file and used as new training/testing data.
2. Stopwords file (named just "english" in this repository) from [NLTK's](http://www.nltk.org/) stopwords corpus. Directly copied from my local installation of the corpus due to issues with Heroku.
